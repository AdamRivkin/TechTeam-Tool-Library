# TechTeam-Tool-Library
The Chicago Tool Library is a tool bank and community maker space that provides Chicagoans with access to tools and resources to learn, share, and create. TechTeam will help redesign and update the Libraryâ€™s Resource Index page to help visitors find tool-related resources around the city. Additionally, we plan to add an interactive map feature to help people find the resource locations physically and, if time allows, a resource submission feature.
